## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/developer-abdiweli-jama/hospital-management-system.git
   cd hospital-management-system
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Update `.env` with your database credentials:
     ```env
     DB_HOST=localhost
     DB_NAME=hospital_db
     DB_USER=root
     DB_PASS=your_secure_password
     DB_CHARSET=utf8mb4
     APP_ENV=development
     APP_DEBUG=true
     ```

4. **Import Database Schema**:
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p hospital_db < sql/schema.sql
   ```

5. **Create Storage Directories**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p storage/logs storage/uploads
   chmod 777 storage/logs storage/uploads
   ```

6. **Run the Application**:
   - Use PHP’s built-in server:
     ```bash
     php -S localhost:8000 -t public
     ```
   - Or configure Apache/Nginx to serve `public/` as the document root.

7. **Access the Application**:
